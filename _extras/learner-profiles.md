title: "Learner Profiles"
---

These profiles describe the potential learners that we anticipate as learners for this lesson. These can be used if you are deciding if this material is right for you or your students. If you plan to contribute material to this lesson, these will help you understand the target audience so that we can have a collaboratively developed, but cohesive lesson.    

## Tyra Crick
 
> Y. is an environmental biologist that uses DNA signatures obtained from
> soils to study species diversity in the environment. 
> She need to compare DNA sequences to large databases. So far, she has
> been able to use web-based tools for her limited datasets.
> 
> Recently, Y has started working with much larger datasets, and
> discovered that the online tool he uses has a limit of 50 entries on the
> online server. 
> He has heard it should be possible to run the same tool through the
> command line, and managed to install it on his local Laptop. 
> Now, however, it takes several days before each of the analyses are
> finished.
> 
> The workshop will teach Y to move his data to and from the university's
> computer cluster, and submit jobs using pre-installed software on the
> cluster. 
> Afterwards, Y will be able to analyze her own data and pre-installed
> command-line based versions of the tool
> to spread the analysis over several dozen cores so it finishes in a few
> hours.

## Maria Newton
 
> A new PhD student is given a task to select parameters for their
> simulation.  They need to run a set of calculations on several thousand 
> combinations of parameters.  One calculation takes several minutes. 
> They set up the problem on their laptop but quickly realise 
> that it would take more than one month to complete the task. 
> They are told to use local HPC but they are not sure how this would help
> them.

## Dana Fisher

A statistics student wants to cross-validate a model. This involves running the model 1000 times -- but each run takes an hour. Running the model on a laptop will take over a month!

## Rina Watson

A genomics researcher has been using small datasets of sequence data, but soon will be receiving a new type of sequencing data that is 10 times as large. It's already challenging to open the datasets on a computer -- analyzing these larger datasets will probably crash it.

## Lucy Navier-Stokes

An engineer is using a fluid dynamics package that has an option to run in parallel. So far, this option was not utilized on a desktop. In going from 2D to 3D simulations, the simulation time has more than tripled. It might be useful to take advantage of that option or feature.
